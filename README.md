# Carpi

This is a personal repository in order to enjoy coding again.
Since I decide otherwise this project will only compile C code compiled
in a somehow-old-but-new coding process.

## Hardware used
* Arduino Uno
* Raspberry Pi 4

## Appendix
### Standards
* //TODO tag will be a comment in code in order to quickly generate a processable backlog file
